# Auto-Irrigation-System
The problems regarding the manual irrigation system were  analyzed and noted. This project aims to solve those problems and thus, add  more value to the new and efficient Auto-irrigation system. 

# Hardware used:
Our system provide water to the plants whenever the soil is dry. In this system, 
we have used a soil moisture to sense the moisture level of the soil. We have 
used a light dependent resistor (LDR) to identify day or night. We have used 
submersible water pump to provide water to the soil. Resistors 10k and 100 
ohms have been used here to control current flow and divide the voltages, 
breadboard for prototyping our project, jumper wires to make connections 
between all the hardware components, LED’s to detect the signals we want the 
user to receive. And last, but not least, Arduino-UNO to interacts through sensor 
with environment and process according to the program stored in it and performs 
output operation.

# Innovation: 
With our project, we can change the old irrigation system with a new and robust 
way to give water to the plants. Our project will help farmers to decrease 
wastage of water, over irrigation, delays in completion of projects, and achieve
irrigation in nighttime.
With our project, farmers don’t have to be in doubt all the time whether soil 
needs water or not. Soil will itself tell the farmer whether to give water to the 
crops or not.
Our Auto Irrigation System will help the irrigation with shortage of water. 
Without over-irrigation, crops will not get ruined
